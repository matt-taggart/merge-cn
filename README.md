# merge-cn
A tiny utility for conditionally merging CSS class names together.

NOTE: Don't use this lol. Should cover all major use cases (see tests), but was just a fun little exercise for me to write. Look for a more robust solution that's more battle-tested and covers more use cases, like https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx
